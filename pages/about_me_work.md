# About Me (in a work sense)

I have written some [essays for colleges](/pages/essays.html). I have a [resume](/media/resume.pdf). I've made projects from ID scanners to cloud server web apps all in Python, which you can find on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Tim-Jackins). I'm proficient with LaTeX; I can make [a lab report](/media/lab5.pdf) look really good. I'm currently learning web design, and I can construct SQLite database websites.

If you have any questions you can contact me by [email](mailto:timmins.jack595@gmail.com).
