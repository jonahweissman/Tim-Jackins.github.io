# About Me (in a work sense)

Here's my [resume](/media/resume/resume.pdf). I've made projects from ID scanners to cloud server web apps all in Python, which you can find on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Tim-Jackins). I'm proficient with LaTeX; I can make [a lab report](/media/PhysicsLab5/lab5.pdf) look really good. I'm currently learning .NET and git.

If you have any questions you can contact me by [email](mailto:timmins.jack595@gmail.com).
