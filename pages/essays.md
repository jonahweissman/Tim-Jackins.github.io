College Essay for VT
===
According to my transcript, I am an average student. My most significant accomplishments, however, were realized outside of the classroom. 
When I arrived at the high school, my interests lead me to the theater.  I served as stage manager, lighting technician, and head of rigging crew. Because of this work,  I received the Award of Excellence in Stage Managing and was inducted into the International Thespian Society.
From then on, I have sought out courses that challenge me.  I was able to bypass preCalculus through independent study and enrolled instead in AP Calculus.  Because of my coding and engineering experience outside of school, I was allowed to skip three years of classes and enroll in Engineering 4.  This year I’m enrolled in Engineering Capstone which is an advanced, independent study course.
I have served local youth in many ways. I was a counselor in a summer program for at-risk children and helped students at Computers4Kids. Managing community outreach for BACON (Best All Around Club of Nerds), I have helped lead several evening STEM events at local elementary schools. I also lead a volunteer tutoring service for CHS students.
I have taken advantage of my resources and opportunities outside of class. I have worked as a counselor, engineer, and software developer at a small startup. The experiences I gained from working are a large part of my education. I feel prepared for both jobs in technology and attending a college that focuses on immersive learning.

College Essay for UVA

When I stay up at night it’s not to watch T.V. or to play video games.  When I stay up, it’s because I’m coding, building circuitry, or designing small machines.  Some may see the world of logic as dismal, as void of emotion. For me, however, it is my passion.  It challenges and excites me.  It is an environment in which I thrive.
The joy I get from writing complex code in C++ or Python is unparalleled to any other because it allows me to step into a world where logic is the driving force. Problems are delineated and I see the path to their solution.  There is nothing like the feeling of compiling a bunch of code and having it work on the first try.  Resolution gives me a great sense of accomplishment.
Whenever I have problems, I read through books. I dive into the data abyss that is the Internet searching through an unending labyrinth of comment forums hoping to obtain even an iota of information that relates to my situation. I am able to utilize information made available by my peers and others older than me who share their knowledge on the Internet.  In turn, I share my code and hacks through Github and Stack forums. Even more enjoyable is the opportunity to share this passion with my friends and collaborate with them.
