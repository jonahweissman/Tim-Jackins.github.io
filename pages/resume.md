# About Me (in a work sense)

I have some essays posted [here](/pages/essays.html). I have my resume [here](/media/resume.pdf). I have some projects on my gihub [here](https://github.com/Tim-Jackins). I've made stuff from scanners to cloud server web apps all in python3, it's my favorite language. I'm pretty proficient with latex, [example](/media/lab5.pdf). I'm currently learning markdown and html and have a good enough grasp, enough to make basic user web pages, on them both.

If you have any questions you can contact me by [phone](mailto:4342276013@myboostmobile.com), (434) 227-6013, or by [email](mailto:timmins.jack595@gmail.com), timmins.jack595@gmail.com.
