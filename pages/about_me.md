# About Me

I use tabs not spaces, unless I'm formating in pep8, I'm an open source enthusiast, and I use ubuntu bionic beaver (18.04).

## Bio

- When I arrived at the high school, my interests lead me to the theater.
  - I served as stage manager, lighting technician, and head of rigging crew. Because of this work, I received the Award of Excellence in Stage Managing and was inducted into the International Thespian Society.
- From then on, I have sought out courses that challenge me.
  - I was able to bypass preCalculus through independent study and enrolled instead in AP Calculus. Because of my coding and engineering experience outside of school, I was allowed to skip three years of classes and enroll in Engineering 4.
- I have served local youth in many ways.
  - I was a counselor in a summer program for at-risk children and helped students at Computers4Kids. Managing community outreach for BACON (Best All Around Club of Nerds), I have helped lead several evening STEM events at local elementary schools, lead a volunteer tutoring service for CHS students, and helped virtualize the engineer
- I have taken advantage of my resources and opportunities outside of class.
  - I have worked as a counselor, engineer, and software developer at a small startup. The experiences I gained from working are a large part of my education.
- I try to share in my learning with any who are interested. I share my code and hacks through Github and Stack forums. I love sharing this passion with friends and colleagues.
